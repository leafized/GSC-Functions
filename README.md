# GSC-Functions
Compilation of GSC functions, as well as game dumps for iw4,iw6,t4,t5,t6,t7,t8,s2 and more will be added.
This project is an independent collection of scripts for call of duty games. These functions are useful for mods, menus, modes, and more.
There is also a utilites file in custom scripts that is from InfinityLoader. These utilities should help with anything in this project.
If any script requires a utility outside of itself, it will be provided in the same file below, or it will be noted that it is inside the utility file.

# Information about this repository
This repository is a collection of scripts I am currently writing, or have written in the past.
These scripts should help mod developers with their work if they choose to use it.

This project is not afiliated with InfinityLoader, Shiversoftdev (or his compiler).

# How to understand s2 gamescripts
- Open iw6 scripts as well as s2 scripts, the hashed functions share similarities and should be easily identifiable.
- Using the https://github.com/leafized/s2functions/ repository, it should be easy to see the comparison.
- Note that this really only applies for MP, ZM uses a lot of unique functions and will require extensive knowledge of scripting styles to sort this out. It's not impossible, but takes time to get used to.
