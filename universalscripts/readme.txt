The scripts in this folder apply to t4,t5,t6,iw4,iw5,iw6 and may need to be slightly tweaked for each game.

Things to take note of:
GSC is often easy to port between cods, but t7,t8, and s2 have either hashed functions, variables, and or custom syntax.
The changes between those games is why i am saying that these scripts may require modification to work for those games.
This logic applies to all scripts within this Repository However.
