As there is no multiplayer menus released I decided to throw this menu together it's basically an `Elite Mossy Remake` and tried to stick to the style, this menu will work both on MP, ZM & SP just make sure you change the mode in infinity loader to the correct gametype, this menu has just basic mods as I don't want to be working on this menu as it's mainly just for people to do MP unlocks, if you find any bugs let me know and if its game breaking I will fix it. credits to Extinct for the base & Serious for the countless help.
